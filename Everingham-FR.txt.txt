The system shall provide a mechanism for the user to enter new tasks.
•	New task entries shall require only a name and
•	Shall provide the option to specify each of the following
o	Description in 150 characters or less
o	Priority (high, medium, or low) - default shall be medium
o	Deadline which shall be entered as a date
o	Category which shall be manually entered in 25 characters or less
o	Recurring frequency (every day, week, month, or year)

The system shall provide capacity for at least 15 current tasks and 50 archived tasks.

The system shall provide a list of tasks to be done each day sorted by urgency (highest urgency at the top). Urgency (U) shall be determined by combining priority (P), entry date (t¬start), today's date (t), and the deadline (tend) into one number by the following equation:
•	U(P, tstart, tend, t) = P-[(tend-t)/(tend-tstart)]
•	If there is no deadline, then U(P, tstart , t) = P-(t-tstart)-1
