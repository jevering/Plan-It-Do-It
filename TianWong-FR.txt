The system shall provide a calculation for task urgency (U), which shall be determined by combining its priority (P), entry date (t­start), current date (t), and deadline (tend) into one number by the following equation:
·         U(P, tstart, tend, t) = P-[(tend-t)/(tend-tstart)]
·         If there is no deadline, then U(P, tstart , t) = P-(t-tstart)-1

The system shall, when provided a future date and time, relay back to the user any tasks scheduled at that specific date and time.

The system shall provide a mechanism for the user to enter new tasks.
·         New task entries shall require only a name and
·         Shall provide the option to specify each of the following:
    o   Description in 150 characters or less
    o   Priority (high, medium, or low) - default shall be medium
    o   Deadline which shall be entered as a date
    o   Category which shall be manually entered in 25 characters or less
    o   Recurring frequency (every day, week, month, or year)
        §  This will be ignored if a deadline has been entered
